### Drill

Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. 
We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?

It depends on the income, past payment history, amount of expense. 
Some people may pay their debt at the end of every month and avoid interest. 
Others may choose to pay . The class attribute can be binary, paid = True not paid = False.
I will create clusters of similar purchases and see which cluster contains many credit defaults. 
The company can predict whether a particular purchase belongs and predict whether it will default or not
It will easier if the data is taken from specific period of time, for example, five years. 
The features will be be groceries, dining out, utilities, entertainment and credit status(paid or default)
